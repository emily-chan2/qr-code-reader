# QR Code Reader 💻✨

A QR code reader that lets you upload images and decode them directly in the browser. Sometimes someone texts me a QR code and I'm like, how do I scan this thing?

---

## 🔹 Features

- Upload a QR code image and read it instantly  
- Countdown timer during scanning so you know it’s working ⏱  
- Result is clickable if it contains a URL  
- Dark mode support (follows your system theme) 🌙  
- Fully client-side — no backend/server needed (you could even save `index.html` to your computer and use it locally)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- QR code reading just works better with your native phone camera since you essentially get like 30 tries per second. With a single image it has to be perfectly clear.
- You'll have better results if you crop your image so just the QR code is visible. Sharpening the image and adjusting the contrast, black point, and noise levels can help as well.
